# Web Scraping with Javascript

### What is web scraping?

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping

Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites.

Web scraping is closely related to web indexing, which indexes information on the web using a bot or web crawler and is a universal technique adopted by most search engines. In contrast, web scraping focuses more on the transformation of unstructured data on the web, typically in HTML format, into structured data that can be stored and analyzed in a central local database or spreadsheet. Uses of web scraping include online price comparison, contact scraping, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, web mashup and web data integration.
